Preact is [web dev]household name at this point. Almost every web developer who's been in tis business for longer than 2 years has heard of it and maybe even tried it themselves. And probably reached the same conclusion as me: **It's awesome!! ðŸ˜»**.

So today, I'm gonna do a deep dive into Preact's source code, and remark on interesting things I find there.

# What is Preact?

In case you're not familiar, Preact is the `3Kb` alternative to the `42KB` of React, by [Jason Miller](https://twitter.com/_developit). It's fully compatible with React's API and supports all packages that rely on React. Its awesome that way.

# Observations

Before we look at the code, I'll remark on some things about Preact.

## Written in TypeScript, but not quite...

Preact source code is written in TypeScript, but the main files themselves aren't. The main files with the functionality are written in plain JavaScript, but they use `JSDoc` to pull in Types from TypeScript Definition files (.d.ts).

An example:

This is the `types.d.ts` file:

```js
export type RenamedType = number | null;
```

And here's the JS file

```js
/**
 * @param {import('./types').RenamedType} a
 * @param {import('./types').RenamedType} b
 * @returns
 */
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

As you can see, the JavaScript code is just that: JavaScript. You won't see TypeScript style type specified in it. Rather all type information is specified in comments, which are ignored completely. There's a whole article about [Using TypeScript without TypeScript](https://puruvj.dev/blog/get-to-know-typescript--using-typescript-without-typescript), but the TLDR; here would be: Avoid development time tooling. if its just plain JS, you don't need to run a file watcher to transpile files as you change them. Just run what you got. And you already got a TypeScript compiler running all the time without you explicitly running it: Your VSCode.

This is a very interesting approach and I see more and more libraries take it up, especially non-UI libraries(For UI libraries, you already got a web server running, so adding in TypeScript in the tooling won't change much, go ahead and add TypeScript)

## Very well written code

I don't need to say this out loud really, but Preact's source code is very very well written and commented, as you'd expect from such a paramount framework.

## It reuses itself a lot

Yup. One of the reasons Preact is so small is that it reuses it's own exported function in its other exported functions. A LOTT!! I'll show you some places where this happens

# Disclaimer

This is not gonna be a complete breakdown, and won't be sequential. Preact is quite a big library to cover in a blog post, so I'll just cover the interesting parts

So, let's begin!! We'll look at some interesting things in the `core` module(i.e., the one when you type `import {} from 'preact'`), then we'll got to hooks

# Core module

## index.js

As is the tradition, lets start with the `index.js` file:

```js
export { render, hydrate } from './render';
export {
  createElement,
  createElement as h,
  Fragment,
  createRef,
  isValidElement,
} from './create-element';
export { Component } from './component';
export { cloneElement } from './clone-element';
export { createContext } from './create-context';
export { toChildArray } from './diff/children';
export { default as options } from './options';
```

Notable points: `h`, which is Preact's JSX factory, is actually named `createElement`. Just like `React.createElement`. But is exported as `h` because it allows you to write raw Preact(Without JSX) ðŸ‘‡

```js
h('div', { class: 'haha' }, h('span', { key: 34 }, h('h1', {}, h('span', {}, 'Whoa'))));
```

Also it is notable that it exports `createElement` as it is too, to maintain compatibility with `React.createElement`

## create-element.js

```js
import options from './options';

/**
 * Create an virtual node (used for JSX)
 * @param {import('./internal').VNode["type"]} type The node name or Component
 * constructor for this virtual node
 * @param {object | null | undefined} [props] The properties of the virtual node
 * @param {Array<import('.').ComponentChildren>} [children] The children of the virtual node
 * @returns {import('./internal').VNode}
 */
export function createElement(type, props, children) { ... }

/**
 * Create a VNode (used internally by Preact)
 * @param {import('./internal').VNode["type"]} type The node name or Component
 * Constructor for this virtual node
 * @param {object | string | number | null} props The properties of this virtual node.
 * If this virtual node represents a text node, this is the text of the node (string or number).
 * @param {string | number | null} key The key for this virtual node, used when
 * diffing it against its children
 * @param {import('./internal').VNode["ref"]} ref The ref property that will
 * receive a reference to its created child
 * @returns {import('./internal').VNode}
 */
export function createVNode(type, props, key, ref, original) { ... }

export function createRef() {
  return { current: null };
}

export function Fragment(props) {
  return props.children;
}

/**
 * Check if a the argument is a valid Preact VNode.
 * @param {*} vnode
 * @returns {vnode is import('./internal').VNode}
 */
export const isValidElement = (vnode) => vnode != null && vnode.constructor === undefined;
```

> Omitted `createElement` and `createVNode` as they're quite big.

Let me blow your mind. `ref`s in P/React are basically used to encapsulate values that shouldn't trigger re-renders and are not re-created on every re-render. Lets see how Preact defines it:

```js
export function createRef() {
  return { current: null };
}
```

A ref is just an object with `current` property set to `null`. It's always advertised as that, but I never thought that it's **actually** an object internally too.

Next up, we have `Fragment`. Its also another astonishing thing.

```js
export function Fragment(props) {
  return props.children;
}
```

Fragment, just returns its `children`. That's all! ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯
