This blog post will be about my reasons to move from Styled Components to SCSS Modules. Its gonna be a raw and non-technical one (i.e., you probably won't learn anything new from it).

# What is styled-components?

Styled Components is a radical, new way of writing CSS for your React components. You can simply create components out of your styles

```tsx
export const Main = () => {
  return <HelloWorld>Hello World</HelloWorld>;
};

const HelloWorld = styled.h1`
  font-weight: 700;
  line-height: 1.618;
`;
```

This is a very, very convenient way of wiring CSS. All your CSS lives in the same file as your main logic. Its ultimate [Colocation](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/colocation/). Plus if you're a freak about small components, this really enforces you to write smaller components, cuz the components grow large very quickly thanks to all 3 techs in a single file: HTML + CSS + TS(Yes, I'm one of those people who dream in TypeScript). So you kinda feel obligated to break your components into smaller pieces, which is ultimately good.

Its just like Svelte and Vue's SFCs. They figured it out correctly, while this makes me mad about React.

Anyways, rant aside, this way of writing is really good, I can't insist enough. Need dynamic prop based styles, no worries, just pass props over to your styled component, and use it in there

```tsx
export const Main = () => {
  return <HelloWorld weight={600}>Hello World</HelloWorld>;
};

const HelloWorld = styled.h1<{ weight: number }>`
  font-weight: ${({ weight }) => weight};
  line-height: 1.618;
`;
```

It makes stuff very very easy. But this is where it starts to go wrong if you don't fully understand how React and its rendering processes work.

And yes, it automatically does the scoping and vendor prefixing. vendor prefixing is runtime generated, that is it determines if the browser needs vendor prefixes, then it will churn out styles with vendor prefixes. Its like a sweet runtime PostCSS and Autoprefixer running in the browser.

# What are CSS Modules?

CSS Modules is a slightly-less radical way of writing CSS. Its basically separate CSS files, but only modular. Syntax remains the same mostly, but it's scoped to the components where it is used (By mangling class names). The general pattern of these is this:

```txt
|-HelloWorld
  |-HelloWorld.tsx
  |-HelloWorld.module.css
```

> Notice I use .css at the end. It could be .scss or .less or .styl too, you name it. I personally use SCSS modules

Notice that out CSS Module has in the name itself that its a module, `*.module.*`. Its a <mark>Convention over Configuration</mark> approach, very prevalent in futuristic bundlers like [ESBuilt](https://esbuild.github.io/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/), etc.

And to use them, you import the css file in JS, and refer to it like this.

```tsx
import css from './HelloWorld.module.css';

export const Main = () => {
  return <h1 className={css.helloWorld}>Hello World</h1>;
};
```

Meanwhile out CSS file:

```css
/* HelloWorld.module.css */

.helloWorld {
  font-weight: 700;
  line-height: 1.618;
}
```

The generated CSS is something like this:

```css
/* HelloWorld.module.css */

.__B56BLAH_helloWorld_4269BRUHBRUH {
  font-weight: 700;
  line-height: 1.618;
}
```

The className is mangled, and the value is substituted in place of `css.helloWorld` in out component.

> Alright I took some artistic liberty and added some weird Elon Musk-y stuff there. The actual mangled output would be much smaller and sane üòÅ

CSS modules are very handy for this. Plus you can add tooling like `autoprefixer` to add vendor prefixes, compile stuff back to old CSS for browser compatibility.

# The app in question

Now the intro is over, lets look at the app which I moved from Styled components to CSS modules. Let me introduce you to my baby, [macos.now.sh](https://macos.now.sh), a macOS Big Sur clone written In Preact, TypeScript and uses Vite as the bundler. Check it out, I think you'll like it (Tip: Just hover over the app dock at the bottom).

Anyways, this whole app was written in Styled Components, until I threw it out of the 30+ components in favour of CSS Modules.

# Why? üßê

## CSS not minified

Take a look at this image üëá

![Unmodified Styled Components](../../static/media/why-move-styled-to-css-modules--unmin-styled-comps-code.png)

This the main production bundle of the app. As you can see, it's minified in some place, and not, in other places. You can see the unminified part is the `CSS` part. These are the styles I wrote as template literals(Or string literals, I mix both up üòÖ). As these aren't CSS to bundler's internal CSS minifier, it stays as it is, which is kinda bummer. I am a die-hard performance freak, and the 1st rule of performance on Web: Bundle and minify your resources. Make them as small as possible, then make them even smaller ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø.

### Why not use the babel plugin? ü§®

If you don't know, Styled Components has a Babel plugin for this purpose exactly, minifying the CSS inside the template literals, and its pretty decent.

But it wasn't working for me.

No literally, it wasn't **working** for me, as in I set up the babel plugin and did the correct config, installed the plugin, but no it wasn't working. Something was going wrong with Vite's plugin running. The plugin was working, as build times had increased a lot from before, but the output was still not minified. The same plugin worked perfectly in a `create-react-app` reproduction I created to check this.

But anyways, even if this problem was solved, there's a bigger Elephant in the room

## CSS injected by JS

All of this CSS still lives in the JavaScript, and is only applied when JS is evaluated by the browser, and
