macOS Dock, when you hover over it, has such a good feedback animation. The current icon your cursor is over becomes big, and the nearby icons become bigger too, but as you move your cursor, the icons' size changes based on distance from your cursor, kinda like this below 👇

Pardon the bad quality 😁.

First off, if you notice closely, that **macOS**. There are no tooltips, no desktop icons, even the animation looks bouncier.

Ladies and Gentlemen, this here is the final product we're gonna make in this blog post using Svelte. In less than 100 lines of logic 😎
