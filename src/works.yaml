    This current website you are viewing 😁. Built in September 2020, it's the second revision.
    It has JPG, PNG -> WebP conversion, generation of responsive images, and fallback mechanisms
    ([Read about it here](https://puruvj.dev/blog/how-i-created-personal-site-part-3)),
    conversion of GIFs to MP4s for performance([Read about it here](https://)). 
    The content is stored as markdown files locally in the `src/blogs` folder, 
    and converted to html and undergoes loads of modifications using [JSDOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom)
    to appear as good as it looks. Thumbnails are generated using Puppeteer every day in Github Actions.

    The official site for Puru Eye Hospital, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. This was the first site I built and 
    deployed online(with a domain). This is the 3rd revision, built in August 2019, the first two being in Angular,
    were **500kb+** in size, while this one had less than **8kb** JS and CSS combined. 
    Images optimized in a similar manner as this blog you're reading.
